## 🧠 How the Chatbot Works

The chatbot uses a **rule-based NLP approach**:
- User input is processed in real-time using JavaScript
- Keywords are matched against predefined personal data
- Relevant and controlled responses are returned
- If the question is outside scope, the bot politely refuses

This design ensures:
- Reliability  
- Zero hallucinations  
- Full control over responses
